## Module Overview

Each file in the `vector_module` serves a specific purpose in the processing and security of vector data:

1. **`quantum_vector_manager.py`**: Manages vector creation, secure splitting, and reconstruction. It coordinates interactions between different layers of the module to ensure vector integrity and security.
2. **`transaction_vector.py`**: Represents individual vectors with attributes, including coordinates and state information, and provides methods for adding layers to vectors.
3. **`transaction_matrix.py`**: Defines matrix structures that support vector transformations and complex operations.
4. **`transaction_layer.py`**: Manages individual layers within a vector, allowing layered transformations and additional metadata storage.
5. **`vss_utils.py`**: Provides verifiable secret sharing (VSS) functions for secure splitting and reconstruction of vector data.
6. **`transaction_protocol.py`**: Defines protocols for transaction handling, ensuring secure data transmission and validation across nodes.
7. **`rle_utils.py`**: Utility functions for compression using Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to reduce vector data size when stored or transmitted.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Vector Creation and Management

The `quantum_vector_manager.py` is the main class that handles vector creation and management. It creates vectors with unique IDs, initializes their layers, and performs secure transformations.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initialize QuantumVectorManager] --> B[Create Vector]
    B --> C[Assign Coordinates and State]
    C --> D[Add Layers to Vector]
    D --> E[Store Vector in Manager]
    E --> F[Vector Ready for Processing]
```

### 2. Secure Splitting and Reconstruction

The `vss_utils.py` module provides VSS functionality, allowing vectors to be split into multiple shares for distributed storage. Shares are encrypted and can be reconstructed if the threshold is met.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initialize Vector for Splitting] --> B[Apply VSS to Coordinates]
    B --> C[Generate Encrypted Shares]
    C --> D[Store Shares across Nodes]
    D --> E[Reconstruct Shares with Threshold]
    E --> F[Recover Original Vector]
```

#### Steps

1. **Split Vector**: The vector’s coordinates are split using VSS, creating multiple encrypted shares.
2. **Distribute Shares**: Shares are distributed across nodes for secure storage.
3. **Reconstruct with Threshold**: The original vector is reconstructed only if enough shares are collected.

### 3. Layered Transformation

The `transaction_layer.py` provides support for adding and transforming individual layers in a vector. Layers can contain different types of data, allowing multiple transformations within a single vector.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Create TransactionLayer] --> B[Add Metadata to Layer]
    B --> C[Transform Layer Data]
    C --> D[Add Layer to Vector]
    D --> E[Vector with Layered Data]
```

### 4. Matrix Operations

`transaction_matrix.py` provides matrix operations for vectors, enabling advanced transformations like rotations, scaling, and dimensional reduction. This is particularly useful for quantum-inspired vector transformations.

```mermaid

    A[Initialize Matrix for Transformation] --> B[Apply Transformation]
    B --> C[Transform Vector Coordinates]
    C --> D[Store Transformed Data in Layer]
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Secure Vector Creation and Storage

1. **Vector Creation**: A vector is initialized with specific coordinates and state information.
2. **VSS Split**: The vector’s data is split into encrypted shares using `vss_utils.py`.
3. **Layered Data Addition**: Different layers are added to the vector, each with its own metadata and transformations.
4. **Secure Storage**: Shares are distributed across nodes for secure storage.

### Scenario 2: Data Recovery from Partial Shares

1. **Share Collection**: Nodes collect shares of a vector.
2. **Threshold Met**: Once the minimum threshold of shares is met, reconstruction begins.
3. **Vector Reconstruction**: Using VSS, the original vector is reconstructed with its layers intact.
