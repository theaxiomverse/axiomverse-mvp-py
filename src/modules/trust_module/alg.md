### Enhanced Trust Algorithm

**Trust Score Formula:**

```
Trust(A, B, t) = decay_factor^(t - last_interaction_time) * (
    alpha * InteractionScore(A, B) + 
    beta * BehaviorScore(A) + 
    gamma * PeerConsensus(A)
)
```

**Where:**

- **InteractionScore(A, B)**: Represents the frequency, quality, and intensity of the interactions between nodes A and B.
- **BehaviorScore(A)**: Measures the behavior of node A within the network based on predefined norms, considering:
  - Honesty in reporting.
  - Adherence to protocols.
  - Stability and absence of malicious activity.
- **PeerConsensus(A)**: Represents the overall consensus of other nodes in the network regarding node A's trustworthiness.

**Weights:**

- **alpha, beta, gamma**: Weight factors that are adjustable based on the desired emphasis for different components of the trust score.

**Decay Factor:**

- **decay_factor**: A value between 0 and 1 that models the trust decay over time when nodes do not interact.
