Structure Overview
Matrix:

Each matrix represents a unit of transactional data that would typically be stored in a block.
It can be organized based on relevant transactional attributes, such as time (e.g., year/month) and transaction type (e.g., payment, deposit, transfer).
Cells within the Matrix:

Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a unique combination of time and transaction type.
Instead of a single transaction record, each cell holds a Layered Vector that contains multiple layers of information about transactions of that type and time period.
Layered Vectors:

Each vector in a matrix cell has internal layers, each layer holding different details about the transaction(s):
Layer 1: Basic transaction details (e.g., transaction ID, sender, recipient, amount).
Layer 2: Verification and consensus information (e.g., cryptographic proof, consensus metadata).
Layer 3: Analytical data (e.g., transaction frequency, patterns).
Layer 4: User-specific data (e.g., notes, flags).
Transaction Flow:

Transaction Creation: A new transaction is added to a specific cell based on its attributes (e.g., time and type).
Consensus/Verification Layer Update: Once verified, the transaction's verification details are added as a new layer or updated in the cell.
Querying and Analysis: Transactions can be queried by matrix criteria (e.g., by month and type) and by layer (e.g., only consensus data).
Implementation Plan in Python
We’ll create the following classes:

TransactionLayer: A class to represent each layer within a transactional vector.
TransactionVector: Holds multiple TransactionLayer objects, representing various details about a transaction.
TransactionMatrix: The matrix structure that holds TransactionVector objects, organized by time and transaction type.
Let’s implement these classes and show how to add, verify, and query transactions within this matrix-based "blockchain-like" system.
